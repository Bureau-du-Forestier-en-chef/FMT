[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What is FMT ? In its most basic form, FMT is an open-source library of functions and objects that you can use in different programming langages : C++, R or Python.\nThe functions and objects of FMT are used to do forest planning. Forest planning answers the question of how a forested landscape should be treated in order to maximize certain objectives (e.g. economic return), under certain constraints (e.g. ecological and conservation objectives, legislation, operational limitations, etc.).\nConcretely, FMT allows you to :\n Read forest planning models based on the Woodstock file format (which are spatially referenced type III linear programming models) Edit and tweak those forest planning models Solve those forest planning models (i.e. generate a schedule of actions which maximize objectives and respect constraints) Make the stand variables and optimized schedule spatially explicit (i.e. mapping the forest operations on a map)  What is it mainly used for ?  Reading Woodstock models Simulating forests landscapes Optimizing/Re-optimizing the models Replanning (by using stochastic events) Resolving aggregation heuristics Plannification of harvest blocs  How does it work technically ? The source code of the functions in FMT is written in the C++ langage.\nHowever, it is made to be compiled into different libraries format that can be used in the Python and R langage.\ngraph TD;\r1--\u0026gt;2;\r1--\u0026gt;3;\r1--\u0026gt;4;\r1[\u0026quot;Programing interface (C++)\u0026quot;]\r2[\u0026quot;Python 2\u0026quot;]\r3[\u0026quot;Python 3\u0026quot;]\r4[\u0026quot;Cran R\u0026quot;]\r Why was it made ? The FMT project started in 2017, at the Chief forester\u0026rsquo;s office (BFEC) of QuÃ©bec.\nBecause the BFEC used Woodstock models every day, there was a need to have replicable code allowing users to automatically read and edit Woodstock models files without using the graphical interface of Woodstock every time.\nIn 2018, the BFEC started to be interested in having a tool to quantify carbon stocks in the forests. The choosen tool (GCBM) made precise estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes, but it needed information about where and when cuts would be made in the forest landscape, according to different managed scenarios.\nBecause of this, a model was needed to transform the spatially referenced information of Woodstock models (which groups all forest of the same types accross the landscape) into spatially explicit information (which contains information for every precise location on a map).\nFrom 2019 to today, many features were made to improve the performance of FMT, and its capacity to make re-plannification.\nWhat are the futur plans for FMT ?  A user interface for certain functions usefull for BFEC analysts, and for its integration with GCBM Spatially explicit optimization (currently, the optimization is done at the spatially referenced level, and its results are then made spatially explicit with heuristics) Better outputs to facilitate integration with other models or scripts   Now that you know so much about FMT, you\u0026rsquo;ll have no trouble understanding how it works, and how to use it.\n FMT uses a model structure and inputs that are very similar to the Woodstock software by Remsoft.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about Woodstock models, you should take some time to read about them before reading this documentation.

FMT is made with a particular structure that is called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). If you never heard of it, here is a very quick summary of it to better understand how to use FMT later.\nIn the OOP approach, the program use different \u0026ldquo;objects\u0026rdquo; that have a certain \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo;, and that can have different \u0026ldquo;functions\u0026rdquo;.\nYou might already know and use functions in software such as R. For example, in R, plot() is a function.\nYou might also be used to some objects and classes being called in software you use. For example, in R, data \u0026lt;- read.csv(data.csv) puts the content of the data.csv file into the data object, which has the class data frame.\nNow, imagine that every function that you use are associated to an object of a particular class. For example, a class dog would have the function bark_at(). If we have a class named cat, we could then :\n Create a new dog object from the dog class : pluto = dog(name = Pluto, age = 8) Create a new cat object from the cat class : felix = cat(name = Felix, age = 2) Make the dog bark at the cat : pluto.bark_at(felix)  In turn, object can have \u0026ldquo;properties\u0026rdquo;, which are exactly what it sounds like. For example, let say that our cat class has three properties : name (which can be a string of characters), age (which can be a number), and scared (which is a boolean, true or false).\nIn our previous example, before using pluto.bark_at(felix), the property felix.scared could be false. But now that we used pluto.bark_at(felix), felix.scared might have changed to true.\nLastly, a parent class in Object Oriented Programming means that the child class will automatically inherit all of the functions and properties of the parent function.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s suppose that we have a animal parent class from which the dog and cat classes derive. If the animal class has a function breathing (animal.breathing()), then the dog and cat classes being its child classes will automatically have this function (dog.breathing() and cat.breathing()).\nObject-Oriented Programming is a particular way to program, embedded in the programming language that you use, that have multiple advantages. One of them is to make things easier to represent.\nIn short : FMT uses Object-Oriented Programming, which makes everything an object with particular functions. The functions and properties of an object are defined by its class.\nTo learn to use FMT, you will learn what its main classes are, so that you can create the objects you need, and make them interact to do the things you want to do. This is because wherever in Python, R or C++, using FMT means using its different objects.\nThe namespaces of FMT The different classes of objects in FMT are grouped into namespaces, which are simply different sections of its files.\nIn FMT, the different namespaces are :\n Parser : Classes used for reading or editing the files of the models in Woodstock format Models : Manipulating and solving the models Spatial : Making things spatially explicit Heuristics : Contains the heuristics used for spatially aggregating the cut blocks, and planning them through time Version : Contain informations about the current version of FMT, and the functions it contains (which depends on how it was compiled)   If you look at the importation of FMT in Python, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that we import the main namespaces that you will need into Python.   Important classes of the Parser namespace The Parser namespace contains two important class for reading models :\n FMTareaparser : Allows the reading and writing of the raster and vector files used in the spatial operations of FMT.  Some of its functions allows you to transform data between vector and raster format.   FMTmodelparser : Allows the reading of a model across all of the Woodstock model files with the readproject() function, or to save it with the write() function after modifying it.  The class also use other classes made to read Woodstock files.    The FMTmodel class The FMTmodel class is the basis of FMT.\nIt contains informations coming from the files of the models, in Woodstock format. This can be seen by looking at the properties of the FMTmodel :\n  However, these attributes are \u0026ldquo;protected\u0026rdquo; so that they are not edited in the wrong way. If you want to read them when using FMT, you will have to use the getter functions that will get them for you :\n  Additionally, you can edit them in the right way by using the setter functions. This allows you to edit different parts of the model.\n  In the end, the FMTModel is what we call a parent class for all of the different class of models that FMT uses, such as FMTlpmodel (linear programming model), and FMTsesmodel (spatialy explicit model) according to the following diagram :\nclassDiagram\rFMTobject \u0026lt;|-- FMTmodel\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsamodel\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsesmodel\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsrmodel\rFMTsrmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTlpmodel\rFMTsrmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTnssmodel\r Observe that all of these classes ultimately inherit from the FMTobject class. This is the case for every object in FMT, as FMTobject contains useful functions and properties for debugging FMT.\nThe FMTnssmodel and FMTlpmodel are spatially referenced models. The FMTlpmodel is used for optimization, while FMTnssmodel is used for simulation.\nMeanwhile, the FMTsesmodel and FMTsamodel are spatially explicit models. In the same way, FMTsamodel is used for optimization, while FMTsesmodel is used for simulation.\nWe will take a closer look at the different types of models later. For now, we will only use the simplest model that correspond to a Woodstock model structure, the FMTlpmodel.\nLoading a simple FMTlpmodel Here is an example of how it looks like to read a linear programming model (in Woodstock format) with FMT.\nIn R, the code to use it would be :\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewmodelparser \u0026lt;- new(FMTmodelparser)\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist \u0026lt;- newmodelparser$readproject(\u0026quot;Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\u0026quot;, c(\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;), TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\rmodel_scenario_lp \u0026lt;- modelslist[[1]]\r# We get the name of the model\rprint(model_scen_lp$getname())\r} else { # if the model hasn't been compiled with OSI, we display an error.\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r}\r In Python, the code would look like this:\nimport sys\rfrom FMT import Models\rfrom FMT import Parser\rfrom FMT import Version\rif __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;:\rif Version.FMTversion().hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;):\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewmodelparser= Parser.FMTmodelparser()\rpath = \u0026quot;Models/TWD_Land/TWD_Land.pri\u0026quot;\rscenarios = [\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;]\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist = newmodelparser.readproject(path, scenarios)\rmodel_scen_lp = modelslist[0]\rprint(model_scen_lp.getname())\relse:\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r Wherever in the R prompt or the Python terminal, the result should give the following :\nReading Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\rFMT 0.9.1, build: Sep 30 2021 12:07:49\rTue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\rReading Scenario Lp\rFMTexc(39)Undefined _death action: _DEATH FMTsection(4)Action\rFMTexc(40)Undefined _death transition: _DEATH FMTsection(5)Transition\rDone reading Tue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\r[1] \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;\r As you can see, FMT indicated that it has read the scenario \u0026ldquo;LP\u0026rdquo;, and returned its name.\nThe Core namespace The Core namespace contains elements used by FMT \u0026ldquo;under the hood\u0026rdquo; to make the FMTModel object function.\nFor example, it contains the objects :\n FMTaction : Class that defines the operability of multiple strata for a given disturbance. FMTtransition : Class that defines the transitions of multiple strata for a given disturbance. FMTyields : Class that defines the growth and yields values for every strata. FMToutputs : Class that defines the outputs in the model (inventory or action based), but not the outputs of the model (e.g., output files or others) FMTconstraints : Class that defines the global constraints and the objective of the model (e.g., variable to optimize).  These different objects can be called from a FMTmodel object with the different getter functions.\nFor example, to see the list of FMTaction objects associated with a particular FMTmodel, you can use the FMTModel.getactions() (or FMTModel$getactions() in R) function, and use a for loop to display every action other it. The actions displayed in such way will correspond to the actions present in the .act file of the Woodstock files for the model.\nHere is an example of displaying the actions and the transitions of a FMTmodel in R code :\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewmodelparser \u0026lt;- new(FMTmodelparser)\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist \u0026lt;- newmodelparser$readproject(\u0026quot;Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\u0026quot;, c(\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;), TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\rmodel \u0026lt;- modelslist[[1]]\r# We get the name of the actions in the model\rprint(\u0026quot;***** Here is the name of the actions\u0026quot;)\rfor (action in model$getactions())\r{\rprint(action$getname())\r}\rprint(\u0026quot;***** Here is the name of the transitions\u0026quot;)\rfor (transition in model$gettransitions())\r{\r# We concatenate the entry for the transition to make it more readable in the prompt\rcat(transition$str())\r}\r} else { # if the model hasn't been compiled with OSI, we display an error.\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r}\r This R code will result in the following text in the R prompt :\nReading Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\rFMT 0.9.1, build: Sep 30 2021 12:07:49\rTue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\rReading Scenario Lp\rFMTexc(39)Undefined _death action: _DEATH FMTsection(4)Action\rFMTexc(40)Undefined _death transition: _DEATH FMTsection(5)Transition\rDone reading Tue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\r[1] \u0026quot;***** Here is the name of the actions\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;CLEARCUT\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;ACARIBOU\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;PLANTATION\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;AFIRE\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;ARECUP\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;_DEATH\u0026quot;\r[1] \u0026quot;***** Here is the name of the transitions\u0026quot;\r*CASE CLEARCUT\r*SOURCE ? ? ?\r*TARGET ? ? ? 100.000000\r*CASE ACARIBOU\r*SOURCE ? ? ?\r*TARGET ? ? ? 100.000000 _LOCK 1\r*CASE PLANTATION\r*SOURCE ? ? ?\r*TARGET ?

Therefore, if you want to compare elements name in FMT make sure the string is in uppercase.\nFor example, if you have an action named Clearcut or clearcut that you want to select, you will need to compare the name of the FMTactions of the models with the string CLEARCUT, all in upper case.\nConversion of errors to warnings All FMT classes inherit from the class FMTobject, and thus share the same FMTexceptionhandler and FMTlogger.\nIf the user want to ignore some error, he can use the function seterrorstowarnings of any FMT class and pass a vector of errors that the handler needs to consider warnings. This function is risky and can lead to errors. It is recommended that you investigate FMT error messages and correct the model accordingly.\n Now that you know everything about the structure of FMT and its basic elements, we will take a look at how to do spatially referenced optimization with it, which is one of the main functions of FMT.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"28124c8adfcb86aa5fb7c74a49d23b63","permalink":"https://bureau-du-forestier-en-chef.github.io/FMT/docs/basics/objects_parsing_interrogation/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/FMT/docs/basics/objects_parsing_interrogation/","section":"docs","summary":"What are objects ?

In a spatially referenced model, entities are associated to regions in space, but not to a precise position in those regions; those regions can be non-continuous. Woodstock models are spatially referenced in nature, as they consider strata that correspond to forests with the same composition and age, which can be dispersed in many places in the landscape. In a spatially explicit model, entities are associated to precise coordinates in space, like in the pixels of a raster map.  The structure of the FMTlpmodel : FMTgraph and FMTdevelopment FMTlpmodel, FMTgraph and FMTdevelopment are three classes that are important to understand how a linear programming model is represented in FMT, and how to solve it.\nFMTlpmodel is a type III linear programming forest planning model, which is spatially referenced.\nIt can solve a type III forest planning model, and get an optimal harvest schedule using constraints and objectives defined by the user.\n The notion of type I, II and III of forest planning models correspond to a particular taxonomy relating to their mathematical structure, and to the way that they can be solved. Type III forest planning models are currently the most advanced type, and can be solved for large landscapes with a lot of forest area. You can learn more about them by reading this article.   The FMTlpmodel contains an object called the FMTgraph, which contains the graph of the model. The graph is an ensemble of nodes linked together with vertices. Each node correspond to a possible state for a particular strata (which are spatially referenced groups of forest forest stands with the same characteristics), with each vertex representing a particular way that it can evolve to another state in the same period of time and between periods.\nHere is a visual representation of a simple FMTgraph, in which a particular strata can evolve from different states (FMTdevelopment objects) with different transitions caused by different actions through the sme period of time. The evolution of the stands takes place between the periods and consists in increasing the age by 1 :\n  A FMTdevelopment is an important class of FMT. It represents a particular strata, which means a particular forest stand that has a given composition, age, and that exists at a particular time period.\nTherefore, the FMTdevelopment object is associated with a FMTmask object, which described the set of attributes (FMTtheme) that defines the FMTdevelopment. This is shown on the following visual :\n  FMTdevelopment is the parent class of two classes, FMTactualdevelopment and FMTfuturdevelopment. An FMTactualdevelopment always represents a strata at the beginning of the planning horizon and therefore contains information about the area. The FMTfuturdevelopment are the possible futures and therefore no area is allocated to them when the FMTgraph is built. This is the result of the optimization that informs us about the future distribution of the area through the FMTgraph.\n  Here are some functions of the FMTdevelopment class that can be important for manipulating the model for different purposes :\n FMTdevelopment.grow() can make the stand grow to see what it will become. Returns an FMTfuturdevelopment identical to the FMTdevelopment from which the function is called but with an increased age of 1 FMTdevelopment.operable() can test if a given action can be applied to this development, based on a yield section (e.g. a particular variable) FMTdevelopment.operate() can operate the stand, and return a vector of FMTdevelopmentpath  Now, we can take a look at how to build the \u0026ldquo;full graph\u0026rdquo; of the model, which is necessary to solve the FMTlpmodel.\nBuilding the full graph of the model The full graph of the model can be built via a repetition of the function FMTlpmodel.buildperiod(). This is essential to solve the model, as FMT will navigate this graph to find the optimal solution according to the objective and the constraints that we will set (see next section).\nThis function requires three parameters :\n A schedule of actions, on the form of a FMTschedule object (it can be empty to obtain the full graph for the model, containing every possibilities) An option to force a partial build (which we will not see right now) Another parameter for class operability (that we will not see either right now, and just set to 1)  Here is the code to build the full graph in R. Pay attention to the to the for loop that builds the different periods.\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewparser \u0026lt;- new(FMTmodelparser)\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist \u0026lt;- newmodelparser$readproject(\u0026quot;Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\u0026quot;, c(\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;), TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\r# We cast the model in the \u0026quot;lpmodel\u0026quot; format for linear programming model by specifying the solver that we want to use\rsolverinterface \u0026lt;- list(CLP=1,MOSEK=2,CPLEX=3,GUROBI=4)\rlpmodel \u0026lt;- new(FMTlpmodel,modelslist[[1]],solverinterface$MOSEK)\r# We create an empty schedule to create the full graph\remptyschedule \u0026lt;- new(FMTschedule)\r# We loop around the different periods to build the full graph\rfor (period in 1:10)\r{\r# We also want the prompt to display what is happening\rprint(lpmodel$buildperiod(emptyschedule,FALSE,1)$str())\r}\r} else { # if the model hasn't been compiled with OSI, we display an error.\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r}\r The equivalent in Python code is the following (notice that in Python, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to make an empty schedule to build the full graph) :\nimport sys\rfrom FMT import Models\rfrom FMT import Parser\rfrom FMT import Version\rif __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;:\rif Version.FMTversion().hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;):\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewmodelparser= Parser.FMTmodelparser()\rpath = \u0026quot;Models/TWD_Land/TWD_Land.pri\u0026quot;\rscenarios = [\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;]\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist = newmodelparser.readproject(path, scenarios)\r# We cast the model in the \u0026quot;lpmodel\u0026quot; format for linear programming model by specifying the solver that we want to use\rlpmodel = Models.FMTlpmodel(modelslist[0], Models.FMTsolverinterface.CLP)\r# We loop around the different periods to build the full graph\rfor period in range(1, 11):\rprint(lpmodel.buildperiod())\relse:\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r The output of both codes should be the following :\nReading Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\rFMT 0.9.1, build: Sep 30 2021 12:07:49\rTue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\rReading Scenario Lp\rFMTexc(39)Undefined _death action: _DEATH FMTsection(4)Action\rFMTexc(40)Undefined _death transition: _DEATH FMTsection(5)Transition\rDone reading Tue Oct 05 10:59:57 2021\rColumns: 58 Rows: 29 Vertices: 60 Edges: 58 Transfer Rows: 29 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 169 Rows: 87 Vertices: 141 Edges: 169 Transfer Rows: 87 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 336 Rows: 164 Vertices: 237 Edges: 336 Transfer Rows: 164 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 553 Rows: 259 Vertices: 350 Edges: 553 Transfer Rows: 259 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 805 Rows: 372 Vertices: 481 Edges: 805 Transfer Rows: 372 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 1088 Rows: 503 Vertices: 630 Edges: 1088 Transfer Rows: 503 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 1407 Rows: 652 Vertices: 797 Edges: 1407 Transfer Rows: 652 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 1762 Rows: 819 Vertices: 982 Edges: 1762 Transfer Rows: 819 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 2177 Rows: 1015 Vertices: 1196 Edges: 2177 Transfer Rows: 1015 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\rColumns: 2660 Rows: 1244 Vertices: 1443 Edges: 2660 Transfer Rows: 1244 Output Rows: 0 Output Columns: 0\r As we can see, the prompt shows us the evolutions of the characteristics of the FMTgraph as it gets built (increasing number of columns, vertices, etc.).\nConstraints and objective Linear programming models come with constraints and objectives, for which we want an optimized solution.\nHence, to solve a FMTlpmodel, we need to set these constraints and objectives into the model before attempting to solve it.\nThese constraints and objectives can be set manually via the FMTlpmodel.setobjective() and the FMTlpmodel.setconstraints() functions.\nMost of the time, you might end up doing the following :\n Getting the constraints that are already in the Woodstock files formulation of the model using the FMTmodel.getconstraint() function. Taking out the first constraint out of the list of constraints that FMTmodel.getconstraint() returns, because the first constraint of this list is actually the objective function of the model. Then, inserting this objective function and the constraints into the FMTlpmodel in order to solve it, by using the FMTlpmodel.setobjective() and FMTlpmodel.setconstraint() functions.  This will result in the following code, in R :\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewparser \u0026lt;- new(FMTmodelparser)\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist \u0026lt;- newmodelparser$readproject(\u0026quot;Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\u0026quot;, c(\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;), TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\r# We cast the model in the \u0026quot;lpmodel\u0026quot; format for linear programming model by specifying the solver that we want to use\rsolverinterface \u0026lt;- list(CLP=1,MOSEK=2,CPLEX=3,GUROBI=4)\rlpmodel \u0026lt;- new(FMTlpmodel,modelslist[[1]],solverinterface$MOSEK)\r# We create an empty schedule to create the full graph\remptyschedule \u0026lt;- new(FMTschedule)\r# We loop around the different periods to build the full graph\rfor (period in 1:10)\r{\r# We also want the prompt to display what is happening\rprint(lpmodel$buildperiod(emptyschedule,FALSE,1)$str())\r}\r# We get the constraints and objectives\rallmodelconstraints \u0026lt;- lpmodel$getconstraints()\r# We define the first constraint of the list as the objective function of the model\rmodelobjective \u0026lt;- allmodelconstraints[[1]]\r# We define all of the other constraints of the list as constraints\rmodelconstraints \u0026lt;- allmodelconstraints[2:length(allmodelconstraints)]\r# We apply all of the constraints to the model\rfor (constraint in modelconstraints)\r{\rprint(lpmodel$setconstraint(constraint)$str())\r}\r# We apply the objective function to the model\rprint(lpmodel$setobjective(modelobjective)$str())\r} else { # if the model hasn't been compiled with OSI, we display an error.\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r}\r The equivalent in Python code is the following (notice that here, we will just \u0026ldquo;take out\u0026rdquo; the objective function out of the list of constraints returned by FMTlpmodel.getconstraints() with the function list.pop(), which we allow us to directly loop around the remaining list for the constraints) :\nimport sys\rfrom FMT import Models\rfrom FMT import Parser\rfrom FMT import Version\rif __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;:\rif Version.FMTversion().hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;):\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewmodelparser= Parser.FMTmodelparser()\rpath = \u0026quot;Models/TWD_Land/TWD_Land.pri\u0026quot;\rscenarios = [\u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;]\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot; (there can be different scenarios for one model)\rmodelslist = newmodelparser.readproject(path, scenarios)\r# We cast the model in the \u0026quot;lpmodel\u0026quot; format for linear programming model by specifying the solver that we want to use\rlpmodel = Models.FMTlpmodel(modelslist[0], Models.FMTsolverinterface.CLP)\r# We loop around the different periods to build the full graph\rfor period in range(1, 11):\rprint(lpmodel.buildperiod())\r# We get the constraints and objectives\rconstraints = lpmodel.getconstraints()\r# We define the first constraint of the list as the objective function of the model\robjective = constraints.pop(0)\r# We apply all of the constraints to the model\rfor constraint in constraints:\rlpmodel.setconstraint(constraint)\r# We apply the objective function to the model\rlpmodel.setobjective(objective)\relse:\rprint(\u0026quot;FMT needs to be compiled with OSI\u0026quot;)\r Solving the FMTlpmodel Once that the full graph is built, and that the constraints and objectives are set, the FMTlpmodel can be solved by using the FMTlpmodel.initialsolve() function. The function returns true or false depending on whether the model was successfully resolved. If the resolution went well, the model retains the solution and the solution can be queried in different ways (an example is shown below).\nBuilding the graph with an existing solution (partial build) Sometime, we might want to get some outputs of a solution/schedule that we already have (see next section) without solving the model all over again, as it was already solved previously.\nIn that case, it is possible to read a solution that was previously found, and to build the FMTgraph of the model by generating only the edges and vertices used by the solution.\nTo that end, three things must be done :\n Reading the schedule file of the scenario, and passing it to the FMTlpmodel.buildperiod() function. Setting the solution for each period with the FMTlpmodel.setsolution() function  If the model contains multiple _LOCKEXEMPT actions, then using FMTlpmodel.setsolution() can throw errors as locks specifications are not part of the solution. In such a case, you should use the FMTlpmodel.setsolutionbylp() function.    This will result in the following code, in R :\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# Creating the parser object to read the model files\rnewparser \u0026lt;- new(FMTmodelparser)\r# Indicating where the model and the existing solution are\rprimarylocation \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;Models/TWD_land/TWD_land.pri\u0026quot;\r# Reading the project with the model parser by specifying that we want the scenario named \u0026quot;LP\u0026quot;

but for R, Python and C++, it is possible to use the FMTmodel.getoutputs() to get a list of the available outputs for a given model.\nIt is possible to select a different FMToutputlevel in order to obtain an output at different scales in the model.\nFor an example of this, see exercise 1.\nExporting the schedule of a solved model Exporting the schedule of a solved model is done via the FMTscheduleparser object that we used when building the partial graph (see previous sections).\nThe solution of a model can be put into a list by using the FMTlpmodel.getsolution() function for each of the period of interest.\nThen, the list of solution for each period must be transformed into a vector, which can then be written in a .txt file using the FMTscheduleparser.write() function.\nFor an example, see exercise 1.\nPre-solving a model Some models can be hard to solve, because of their high number of actions, strata, and so on.\nIn such case, the FMTmodel.basepresolve() function can be used to pre-solve the model.\nWhat this function does is to return a model with less themes, actions, transitions, outputs and constraints compare to the original model, but with the same amount of information. This makes it easier to solve, while giving the same answer in the end.\nIn some situations, FMT will pre-solve the model automatically.\n Now that you know everything there is to know about spatially referenced optimization in FMT, we recommand that you try the exercise 1 to help you learn using FMT in practice.

In a spatially referenced model, entities are associated to regions in space, but not to a precise position in those regions; those regions can be non-continuous. Woodstock models are spatially referenced in nature, as they consider strata that correspond to forests with the same composition and age, which can be dispersed in many places in the landscape. In a spatially explicit model, entities are associated to precise coordinates in space, like in the pixels of a raster map.  The FMTsesmodel FMTsesmodel is a particular model that gives the user the opportunity to spatialize solutions coming from any FMTsrmodel class, which are the spatially referenced models (see objects, model parsing and interrogation and spatially referenced optimization).\nNote that we are not talking about optimizing a spatially explicit model; this is quite a complex task that is still on the roadmap of FMT (and which is the goal of the FMTsamodel class).\nclassDiagram\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsamodel\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsesmodel\rFMTmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTsrmodel\rFMTsrmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTlpmodel\rFMTsrmodel \u0026lt;|-- FMTnssmodel\r Instead, the FMTsesmodel will try to spatialize the schedule of a FMTsrmodel by placing cut blocks on a map, by doing multiple iterations of simulating the placement of these blocks, and by selecting the best solution that is found.\nTo use a metaphor, this would be like trying to find a winning position at chess if you don\u0026rsquo;t find yourself capable of finding it by thinking carefully about the placement of your chess pieces : you could try to place your pieces randomly many, many times, and asking each time if you have won, or if you are closer to victory, and if the position of the chess pieces respect the rules of the game.\nHere, FMTsesmodel will try to place cut blocks according to the solution of a FMTsrmodel (which is a schedule of forest operations applied to spatially referenced strata). Its goal will be to find the best positioning possible, by accommodating to the constraints that are set in their placement as best as possible, and by maximizing the objective value (e.g. maximizing the harvested wood).\nHowever, this method have a low chance of finding the optimal placement, if one exists; instead, the more iterations it does in trying to place them, there higher the chance to find a solution that is as close as possible as an optimal placement of the cut blocks in space. This is why this process represents what we call a heuristic.\nThe spatial framework inside FMT FMT uses FMTlayers to represent any spatially explicit solution.\nA FMTlayer can be compared to a regular raster file in which pixels can contain pretty much any type or class of forest stand.\nIn the FMTsesmodel, we use the FMTspatialschedule class to represent a spatially explicit solution, which itself is a FMTlayer of FMTlinegraph.\nEach FMTlinegraph is a linear version of the FMTgraph described in spatially referenced optimization. What that means is that they show the evolution of the FMTdevelopment inside the pixel from the beginning to end of the periods that we want to take into account.\nThe FMTspatialschedule class The FMTspatialschedule class contains a spatially explicit solution under the form of a FMTlayer.\nIt contains an important function, FMTspatialschedule.getsolutionstatus(), which prints important information about how much the solution contained in the FMTspatialschedule achieves the objective function of the model.\nThis function also gives a value of the primal infeasibility, which gives an idea of how much the current solution does not respect all of the constraints of the model at once.\nNote that unlike the FMTschedule object which only concern one periods of time (which is why the code shown in the section about spatially referenced optimization contained a for loop around the number of period of interest when dealing with the FMTschedule class), FMTspatialschedule contains a solution for multiple periods of time at once.\nThe FMTlinegraph As said earlier, the spatial structure of a FMTsesmodel is like a raster map made of pixels, with each pixels being a FMTlinegraph.\nIn a FMTlinegraph, each node stands for the state of the strata inside the pixel and each edge stands for an action (e.g. cleartcut) or natural growth, as shown of this image :\n  However, on the contrary of the FMTgraph object described in the section about spatially referenced optimization, the FMTlinegraph does not contain a complete enumeration of all possible actions and states possible for the strata in the pixel : instead, it only contains one solution, or one evolution possible for the strata.\nMaking transitions with single outputs A limitation of the FMTlinegraph class is that one cannot use multiple output transitions, meaning transitions that results in two different strata or other outputs, as illustrated below :\n  Therefore, you will need to modify the transitions of an FMTmodel to be able to use them in a FMTsesmodel.\nTo that end, you can use the FMTtransition.single() function, which automatically transforms multiple outputs transitions into single output transitions.\nOnce that the transitions have been transformed as single transitions, you can use the FMTsesmodel.settransitions() function to set the new generated transitions into the FMTsesmodel.\nSpatial events The FMTspatialschedule also keeps tracks of the areas affected by particular actions under the form of space time events with the class FMTevent, as is shown here :\n  FMTevent can represent any kind of spatially explicit disturbance (cut, fire, etc.). It is associated with the time period of the event, and the coordinates of the spatial event.\n  The initial forest map As a spatially explicit model, the FMTsesmodel requires spatially explicit informations about the forests in the landscape at the beginning of the planning horizon.\nTo get this information from a Woodstock model (that might have served to create a FMTlpmodel that you optimized; see spatially referenced optimization), you will need to retrieve this information from the vector file that serves as the Woodstock model\u0026rsquo;s map. This vector file contains information about the theme, age and lock attributes for each strata which will need to be transferred into multiple spatially explicit rasters.\nAll of this information will be contained in the FMTforest object, which is the equivalent of the model\u0026rsquo;s map, but that is based on a FMTlayer. Each pixel of a FMTforest object contains a FMTactualdevelopment object.\nThe FMTareaparser class can be used to generate the FMTforest needed for the FMTsesmodel, as it contains functions to read vectorial or raster maps from a Woodstock model.\n FMTareaparser.vectormaptoFMTforest() allows you to read an existing vector (shapefile) map FMTareaparser.readrasters() allows you to read existing rasters maps  Both functions require several parameters to properly identify the themes that are needed, and specify several spatial characteristics of the FMTforest class that you will create.\nOnce that the FMTforest is created, it needs to be given to the FMTsesmodel by using the FMTsesmodel.setinitialmapping() function.\nUsing new keywords in Woodstock files for spatial constraints In a usual Woodstock model, spatial constraints are not taken into account. However, you will certainly need to use some for a spatial simulation with the FMTsesmodel to place the cut blocks of the optimized schedule.\nTo that end, FMT can read two new keywords in the optimize section of a Woodstock model that do not exist in the original Woodstock syntax.\nThese keywords are _SIZE and _ADJACENCY.\n_SIZE is to be used with the following syntax in the optimize section of a Woodstock model :\n_SIZE(ACTION, NEIGHBORSIZE) \u0026gt;= \u0026lt;SIZE IN PIXELS\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PERIODS\u0026gt;\nNote that :\n ACTION can also be an aggregate of several actions, so that multiple actions can be subject to the same constraint NEIGHBORSIZE describe how the spatial event spread from one pixel to another pixel, following this graph :   \u0026lt;PERIODS\u0026gt; correspond to the period of time for which to set the constraint  As such, the _SIZE constraint can give a minimal or maximal size for the event of specified actions, in number of contiguous pixels. It will result in the creation of spatial blocks of pixels where the action has been applied.\nMeanwhile, _ADJACENCY is used with the following syntax :\n_ADJACENCY(ACTION, GREENUP) \u0026gt;= \u0026lt;DISTANCE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PERIODS\u0026gt;\nWith :\n ACTION can again be an aggregate of several actions, so that multiple actions can be subject to the same constraint. \u0026lt;PERIODS\u0026gt; again correspond to the period of time for which to set the constraint. DISTANCE corresponds to the minimal or maximal adjacency distance between two spatial blocks of one or several actions (whose size was defined by _SIZE). Hence, for a DISTANCE \u0026gt;= 3, we will have the following :   GREENUP correspond to the number of time periods for which we consider two events to be neighbours. For example, if GREENUP is equal to 3, two spatial blocks of actions that are under the maximal distance indicated by DISTANCE but which are separated temporally by 4 periods will not be considered spatially adjacent; however, if they were separated by 3, 2 or 1 period, or are in the same period, they will be considered spatially adjacent.  Making the simulation with FMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() Once that you have a spatially-referenced solution/schedule (see spatially referenced optimization) and that you have set the initial landscape for the FMTsesmodel (see previous sections), you can use FMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() to make the simulation proper, and obtain a spatially-explicit schedule based on the spatially-referenced schedule.\nFMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() needs a the spatially-referenced solution of a FMTlpmodel (or a FMTnssmodel), in the form of a FMTschedule object. This solution describes which development (or strata) get harvested for one period, with which action, and at which surface/area.\nThe FMTschedule from a solutioned FMTlpmodel or FMTnssmodel can be retrieved using their function getsolution(). However, the function will retrieve the solution for one period; we will have to loop around the periods to get the solutions for every period of interest, and to indicate if we want the solution to take into account locked developments.\nFMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() will build a spatially explicit solution from a spatially-referenced one for a given period. Along with the FMTschedule for the period, the function will need a randomiterations argument which is the maximal number of iterations done by the algorithm before it stops when no increase in the objective function value (maximization) or decrease in the primal infeasibility value was found. This is because the simulation consist of iterations where the model will try to place cutblocks in space according to the spatially-referenced schedule in order to increase the objective function of the model (e.g., volume harvested) while respecting the linear and spatial constraints that was given (whose deviation from is represented by the primal infeasibility value).\nA last input is a seed number that will be used to generate random numbers used for creating the cut blocks at each iteration. This system of seed allows FMT to use random numbers that are \u0026ldquo;replicable\u0026rdquo;; that means, if you keep the same seed, FMT will get the same random numbers, and will do the exact same simulations.\nHere is a representation of how the simulation algorithm functions in practice :\n  In R, the code to use FMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() will look like this :\nlibrary(FMT) # Loads FMT into R\rif (new(FMTversion)$hasfeature(\u0026quot;OSI\u0026quot;)) # Checks if FMT has been compiled with OSI by creating a new FMTversion object, and using the function hasfeature().\r{\r# We read and solve a FMTlpmodel;

Each time, FMT starts with a first iteration of placing the actions in space while trying to respect the constraints. Then, the algorithm ends when it either get stalled, or stuck, meaning that it can\u0026rsquo;t improve the solution or reduce the primal infeasibility anymore. It then displays the amount of actions that it was able to place in space.\nNote that stalled and stuck have two different meaning :\n Stalled means that the algorithm have generated the same exact solutions (the same placement of the cuts in space) as its 3 last iterations, implying that it cannot generate any new solution. This can happen when the constraints makes it so that the number of potential solutions are limited, which means that the algorithm will quickly have tried them all. Stuck means that the algorithm was able to generate different solutions; but that all of these new solutions have an objective function value that is not higher than the previous ones, or that these new solutions cannot reduce the primal infeasibility. After a number of iterations corresponding to the randomiterations arguments provided to FMTsesmodel.Greedyreferencebuild() without any improvements, the algorithm will stop.
