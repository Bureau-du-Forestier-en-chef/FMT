## [Unreleased] - 2026-09-17 (8fb920c1)

### Added

- Migrated additional business services to `FMTWrapperCore`, including the Operating Area and Area Variability domains, continuing the separation of business logic from the .NET wrapper.
- Added automated COIN-OR stack builds for RTools, including GLPK, CLP and MOSEK-enabled environments.
- Strengthened the commit message generation workflow with centralized validation and improved error handling.

### Changed

- Refactored the bounds subsystem by splitting bounds and specification classes into dedicated modules, improving maintainability (#202).
- Continued the migration toward the `FMTWrapperCore` architecture with controller updates, code cleanup and expanded test coverage.
- Renamed the Core export macro to `FMT_WRAPPER_CORE_EXPORT` for API consistency.
- Updated Doxygen documentation, embedded changelog content and R examples to match the current architecture and naming conventions.
- Migrated the Core namespace from `FMTWrapperCore` to `FMTWrapper::Backend` across the Core library, tests and wrapper code. The library name, CMake target and `FMTWrapperCore` directory remain unchanged.
- Updated the .NET wrapper and test suite to consistently use the new `FMTWrapper::Backend` namespace.

### Fixed

- Fixed Core symbol export definitions for shared builds.
- Fixed parser issues affecting action mapping and theme comparison logic (#341).
- Resolved several issues uncovered during the final stages of the Core migration effort.
- Improved retrieval and display of error descriptions in the user interface (#336).
- Fixed and updated integrated Change Log generation (#328).
- Fixed an issue preventing reinterpretation of the ROOT scenario (#244).
- Added and validated GLPK support in supported environments (#276).
- Improved stability of logging and warning-handling components during Core migration work.

### Breaking: Changed

- **Breaking:** the public C++ Core API now uses the `FMTWrapper::Backend` namespace instead of `FMTWrapperCore`. Client code referencing `FMTWrapperCore::*` must be updated.
