[FMT](https://github.com/gcyr/FMT) is a program that requires to be **compiled** on your computer so that it can be executed.

**Don't worry**; it's not as complex as it seems !

## What is compilation ?

Compilation is a step where your computer will transform the **source code** (which are files that you, a human, can read) of the program into a set of **binaries** (which are files that your computer can read).

You use binaries every day, without even thinking about it; for example, a **`.exe` file on Windows is a binary**. If you open it with the Windows notepad, you will not be able to understand its content, but your computer can.

## What is needed to compile ?

To compile [FMT](https://github.com/gcyr/FMT), your computer will need :

- The source code of FMT
- All of the libraries of functions that FMT use
- A compiler

The documentation will guide you for all of these steps.

Preparing everything takes around half an hour, but the download and compiling takes about 6 hours (but you don't need to do anything while your computer does it).

{{% callout warning %}}
Currently, this documentation for compiling FMT only covers installing FMT for Windows 8-10, and for use under Python.

If you're a Mac or Linux user, or if you want to use FMT in `R`, please warn us in the [issue section of the FMT repository](https://github.com/gcyr/FMT/issues).
